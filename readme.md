A trend of using Go programming language over JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js) in iGaming industry is something I am glad to see.

Node run-time presented us with a great offer, use your front-end programming language on the back-end. This way the skillset needed to build application become more narrov and uniformal in a positive way. However, the JavaScript/TypeScript are not ideal languages to say the least, I could go deep into comparing them with Go, but that is another topi in itself.

I crafted this proof of concept in Go language to show that front-end components can indeed be developed with it. Go deserves a chance to prove itself as a replacement of Node run-time, at least in the context of iGaming.

For this PoC (https://github.com/zarkones/slots-poc) I used [Fyne](https://fyne.io/) GUI framework. It can be compiled to web, desktop and mobile. There is another strong candidate [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) which also has cross-platform support.
